## Description

This project is a Bookkeeper API containing books within a 'booklist.' Each book contains the title, author, description and genre.

The program allows the user to have a book stored in their 'booklist' as well as allowing them to categorise them into "Reading," "Read" and "To_Read" to add further personalisation.

The user is able to filter books based on author, genre and rating.

### Users:
A user object contains an id, full name, an email address and their own booklist. 

### Books:
Books contains an id, title, author, description and genre.

### OwnedBook:
OwnedBook contains the status, user and book.

### Class Diagram 
The class diagram shows the relationships and attributes of each model. It can be found in the "UML Diagram Backend Final.png" file.

*Please also refer to the above video when using Postman*

### RESTful route endpoints

#### To access the program, use `https://localhost:{port}/{endpoint}` - the default port is 8080.

Each model - User, Book and OwnedBook - have REST controllers that provide basic CRUD functionality, specifically Index, Show, Create, Update and Delete routes. The User and Book models also have additional functionality, described below: 

- INDEX: 
  - `GET http://localhost:8080/books` returns all books in JSON format and can be accessed via web browser
  - This method is available for all other models

- SHOW:
  - `GET http://localhost:8080/books/{bookId}` returns books with unique id = {id} and can be accessed via web browser

- CREATE:
  - `POST http://localhost:8080/books` creates a book with a unique id, and returns the created book. 
  - Attributes of this new book must be sent within the request body in Postman.

- UPDATE:
  - `PUT http://localhost:8080/books/{bookId}` updates books with unique id = {id} and returns the updated book. 
  - All attributes, changed or not, must be included in the request body in Postman.

- DELETE:
  - `DELETE http://localhost:8080/books/{bookId}` deletes book with unique id = {id}. 
  - This must be done in Postman. If delete request is successful, Http status 202 - no content - is returned.
  
### Filters and Sort
  
The book model contains filters and a sort that allow the user to narrow their search. Filters can be applied based on author, genre and rating. Books can also be sorted by title, author and rating.
